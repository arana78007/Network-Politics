# Network-Politics
A network-work-based model of the political views of two groups. Inspired by the left and right-wing seen in modern politics. Optimizing opinions on the network via gradient learning creates cyclical behaviours or prejudice formation where opinions deviate indefinitely. 
Code is useful to study two-group behaviours, just adjust the functional forms used in the code for your interests.
